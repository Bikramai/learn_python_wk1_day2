# # Block Letters

# ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from individual characters.
# Write a Python program called initials.py that displays the initials of your name in block letters as shown and dip your toes into ASCII art.
# ASCII art of letters. For example, the ASCII art of the letter F is comprised of 5 characters in the first row, one character in the second and third rows, three characters in the fourth row, and one character in the fifth, sixth, and seventh row. 
# These characters when viewed together look like the letter F

# What we are building in this project:

# Take a look at the complete alphabet and find your initials. Notice how each block letter is 7x5 and formed by the letter itself.
# My initials are S and L, so my initials.py program should output:

#  SSS   L
# S   S  L
# S      L
#  SSS   L
#     S  L
# S   S  L
#  SSS   LLLLL

# Once you are ready, mark this task complete by checking off the box.

print( "SSS   L")
